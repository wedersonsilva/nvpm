1 Introduction                      *nvpm-intro* {

NVPM stands for `NeoVim Project Manager` . It's
mission is to assist the user on managing large
quantities of files in any project. 

The main goal is to create a tree-like structure
in order to overcome the linearity of Neovim's
bufferlist.

To do that, the creator was forced to `totally`
ignore how Neovim handles each loaded file.

The approach here is to make a plan about which
files the user wants to open and then write what
is called a |project-file-descriptor|. Those files
follow the |NVPM-Markup-Language|, which was
specific created for the only purpuse of
describing which files the user will open every
time nvpm is called.

2 Context                         *nvpm-context* {


For small projects, Neovim's bufferlist will do
just fine. You can open all the files in different
tabs and move arround with ease. The problem only
appears when you start to increase files and
directories in your project.

Lets then go through the process of what could
happen if the user wants lets say write a C
Library that handles geometric calculations. This
project can start small, lets say:
>
  $tree ~/libgeo/

  libgeo/
  ├── main.c
  └── readme.txt
  
  0 directories, 2 files
<

In such cases, the user can open each file at a
time and edit them separately. But very soon the
situation can change into separate modules for the
library. Say:

>
  tree ~/libgeo/

  libgeo/
  ├── main.c
  ├── readme.txt
  └── src
      ├── line.c
      ├── line.h
      ├── plane.c
      ├── plane.h
      ├── point.c
      └── point.h

  1 directory, 8 files
<

In such a case, not only another hierarchy was
created, but 6 more source and header files as
well.

It can always get uglier! The user might want to
make separate tests, assisted by a Makefile. Not
only that, as soon as the modules increase in
number, more hierarchies might be necessary. 

And what about creating a git repository, a
documentation folder, install, uninstall and
helper scripts. Well, very quickly, the user 
might face the following structure of files:

>
  tree -a libgeo/

  libgeo/
  ├── bin
  ├── doc
  │   ├── libgeo-dev.txt
  │   └── libgeo.txt
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── lib

  │   ├── helper.sh
  │   ├── install.sh
  │   └── uninstall.sh

      ├── common.h
      ├── data
      │   ├── list.c
      │   ├── list.h
      │   ├── string.c
      │   ├── string.h
      │   ├── tree.c
      │   └── tree.h
      ├── main.c
      ├── math
      │   ├── complex.c
      │   ├── complex.h
      │   ├── matrix.c
      │   ├── matrix.h
      │   ├── real.c
      │   ├── real.h
      │   ├── vector.c
      │   └── vector.h
      └── shapes
          ├── line.c
          ├── line.h
          ├── plane.c
          ├── plane.h
          ├── point.c
          └── point.h

  12 directories, 52 files

Well how about that? Not we have many more files
and directories, divided into folders and
subfolders. Not only that, we have now different
categories of files being source code, scripts,
documentation, git , and test files. If the
user tries to open them all, I'm more than sure
that only one instance of Neovim won't be enough 
to see them all.

And even if the user defies logic and open all of
them, there won't be enough screen to keep them
all being display, which may force the user to
create splits, tabs, hidden buffers, etc, etc.

3 NVPM Lang               *nvpm-markup-language* {

The markup language to describe projects is having
the folowing keywords:

>
  workspace
  tab
  buff
  term
<


Note 
  see ** for new projects

|workspace|: receives a workspace name.

  Syntax  : `workspace <workspace-name>`
  Examples:
>
  workspace Code
  workspace Docs
  workspace LibGeo Code
  workspace LibGeo Scripts
<

|tab|: receives a tab name.

  Syntax  : `tab <tab-name>`
  Examples:
>
    tab Main
    tab Doc
<

|buff|: receives a buffer name and path.

>
  buff main : src/main.c
  buff make : Makefile
<
|term|: receives a terminal name and command.

>
  term home : bash
  term tree : ranger
<
